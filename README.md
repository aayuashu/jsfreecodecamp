<h2>VARIABLES</h2>
Variables -> letters, numbers, dollar shign, and underscores <br>
            must not begin with number <br>
            can't contain spaces <br>
keywords: let  <br>eg: let hello; <br> <br>
When variables names are more than one word, use Camelcase: first word is entirely lowercase, but following words are all title-cased. <br>
eg: let variableOne; <br>
let secondVariable; <br>
let yetAnotherVariable; <br>
let thisIsAnAbsurdlyLongName; <br> <br>
When variable is declared without initializing it, it is considered uninitialized
eg:let secondCharacter; <br>
console.log(secondCharacter); <br>
output: undefined <br>
assign values using assignment operator = <br>
eg: let hello = "Hello"; <br>
variable declared with let can be reassigned(change value of) <br>
Note: When reassigning a variable, you do not use the let keyword again.  <br>
eg: let programmer = "Naomi"; <br>
programmer = "CamperChan"; <br>
One variable value can be assigned to another variable <br>
eg:let first = "One";<br>
let second = "Two";<br>
second = first; <br>
